# Unit 2: Research Plan – Full Summary

## 1. Research Problem

Research cannot start without a problem.  
A research problem is a difficulty faced in theory or practice.  
The aim of research is to solve this difficulty.

A research problem is usually written as a question.  
It gives direction and purpose to the research.

### Sources of Research Problems

Research problems can come from:

- Business and management problems  
- Day-to-day life problems  
- Technological changes  
- Unexplored or less explored areas  
- Books, theses, research articles  
- Government and policy issues  
- Discussions with experts or supervisors  

### Selection of a Research Problem

While selecting a problem, the researcher should ensure that it:

- Is original or less studied  
- Is useful and socially relevant  
- Matches the researcher’s interest and ability  
- Fits the area of specialization  
- Is manageable in size  
- Has clear objectives  
- Is feasible in terms of data, time, money, and access  

### Specification of the Problem

Specifying a problem means making it clear and exact.  
A well-defined problem clearly states:

- What is to be studied  
- Why it is studied  
- How it will be studied  
- When and where it will be studied  
- Who will use the results  

A problem well defined is half solved.


## 2. Formulation of Objectives

After defining the problem, research objectives are set.  
Objectives explain what the research wants to achieve.

Research objectives:

- Give direction to the study  
- Decide data sources and methods  
- Guide analysis and conclusions  

Objectives must be clear, specific, and focused.


## 3. Hypothesis

A hypothesis is a tentative answer or explanation of a problem.  
It is an assumption that must be tested using data.

### Types of Hypothesis

- Explanatory hypothesis  
- Descriptive hypothesis  
- Analogical hypothesis  
- Working hypothesis  
- Null hypothesis  
- Statistical hypothesis  

### Criteria for a Good Hypothesis

A good hypothesis should be:

- Testable using facts  
- Relevant to the problem  
- Able to explain and predict facts  
- Based on existing knowledge  
- Simple and clear  
- Definite and specific  
- Testable with available methods  

### Stages in Hypothesis

1. Feeling the problem  
2. Formulating the hypothesis  
3. Deductive development  
4. Testing or verification  

### Testing of Hypothesis

A hypothesis can be tested:

- Directly through observation or experiment  
- Indirectly through logical deduction  
- Using statistical methods  

Statistical testing involves:

- Null hypothesis (H₀)  
- Alternative hypothesis (H₁)  
- Sample data and test statistics  


## 4. Research Design

Research design is the plan or blueprint of research.  
It explains how the study will be conducted.

Functions of research design:

- Provides a clear plan  
- Sets boundaries of research  
- Helps foresee problems  
- Guides answers to research questions  

### Components of Research Design

A research design includes decisions about:

- Need for the study  
- Review of previous studies  
- Statement of the problem  
- Objectives of the study  
- Hypotheses  
- Operational definitions  
- Scope of the study  
- Sources of data  
- Method of data collection  
- Tools and techniques  
- Sampling design  
- Data analysis methods  
- Presentation of results  
- Time schedule  
- Financial budget  
- Administration of the study  

Research design is flexible and may change as research progresses.


## 5. Pilot Study and Pre-Testing

### Pilot Study

A pilot study is a small version of the main study.  
It helps the researcher understand:

- The problem  
- The population  
- Field difficulties  
- Research tools  

It improves research design and planning.

### Pre-Testing

Pre-testing is a trial use of research tools.  
It helps identify weaknesses in tools like questionnaires.  
Based on feedback, tools are revised before final use.

### Difference

- Pilot study: Small complete research study  
- Pre-testing: Trial test of a research tool  


## Conclusion

Unit 2 explains how to plan research step by step.  
It covers problem selection, objectives, hypothesis, research design, pilot study, and pre-testing.  
A clear problem, strong hypothesis, and proper design are key to successful research.
