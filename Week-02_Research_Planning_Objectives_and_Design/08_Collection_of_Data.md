## 2.6 Pilot Study and Pre-Testing

A pilot study is a small-scale version of the main study.  
It is conducted before the actual research begins.

After selecting a research problem,  
a plan is prepared to carry out the study.  
However, the researcher may not fully know:

- The subject matter  
- The nature of the population  
- The issues involved  
- The tools and techniques to be used  

In statistics, the term **population** means the full group  
from which a sample is selected.

To gain proper understanding,  
a small study is conducted first.  
This small study is called a **pilot study**.

A pilot study helps in:

- Understanding the research problem clearly  
- Knowing the size and nature of the population  
- Identifying field-level problems  
- Improving research tools and methods  

It follows all steps of research,  
but on a smaller scale.

A pilot study also helps in preparing  
a clear and well-defined research design.

**Pre-testing** is an important part of scientific research.  
It means testing the research tool before final use.

Pre-testing is the trial use of a tool on a small group.  
This is done before using it in the main study.

In daily life, we often test things before final use.

**Examples:**

- Tasting food before serving it  
- Trying a suit before final stitching  
- Taking a test drive before buying a vehicle  

Similarly, research tools like:

- Questionnaire  
- Interview schedule  
- Measurement scale  

are first tested on a trial basis.

This trial use helps to find problems in the tool.  
It may show unclear questions or other weaknesses.

While designing the tool,  
the researcher tries to be careful.  
Still, all defects may not be noticed at that time.

When others use the tool,  
they can point out problems more clearly.  
So, the tool must be tested using actual responses.

Based on feedback from pre-testing,  
the tool is corrected and improved.  
After changes, the final tool is prepared for the main study.

The difference between pilot study and pre-testing is clear.

- A **pilot study** is a small complete research study.  
- **Pre-testing** is only a trial test of a specific tool,  
  such as a questionnaire.

## 2.7 Let Us Sum Up

Research cannot begin without a problem.  
A problem is a difficulty faced by a researcher.  
It may be theoretical or practical.

The aim of research is to solve this difficulty.  
A research problem is usually written as a question.

If a researcher already has a problem,  
the research can begin directly.  
If not, the researcher must search for a problem.

Research problems can come from:

- Business issues  
- Functional areas of management  
- Day-to-day problems  
- Technological changes  
- Unexplored areas  
- Books, theses, and articles  
- Government policy issues  

After selecting a problem,  
it must be clearly defined and specified.

The next step is to set research objectives.  
Objectives give direction to the study.

The researcher then suggests possible solutions.  
These suggested solutions are called hypotheses.

There are different types of hypotheses, such as:

- Explanatory hypothesis  
- Descriptive hypothesis  
- Analogical hypothesis  
- Working hypothesis  
- Null hypothesis  
- Statistical hypothesis  

A good hypothesis should be:

- Testable using facts  
- Relevant to the problem  
- Able to explain facts  
- Based on existing knowledge  
- Simple, clear, and definite  

There are four stages in a hypothesis:

a) Feeling the problem  
b) Formulating the hypothesis  
c) Developing the hypothesis using logic  
d) Testing or verifying the hypothesis  

Hypothesis testing can be done directly or indirectly.  
It can also be done using logical and statistical methods.

After selecting the problem and forming objectives and hypotheses,  
the researcher prepares a plan of action.  
This plan is called the research design.

The research design includes decisions about:

- Definitions  
- Scope of study  
- Methods and techniques  
- Procedures and tools  
- Time and place  
- Cost and administration  

If the research problem is not familiar,  
a pilot study may be conducted first.

Research tools must be prepared carefully.  
These tools should be pre-tested  
before being used in the main study.

## 2.8 Key Words

**Hypothesis:**  
A hypothesis is a temporary answer or solution to a research problem.  
Its truth has to be tested.

**Pilot Study:**  
A pilot study is done to understand the research problem clearly.  
It helps the researcher gain enough knowledge  
to carry out the main study properly.

**Pre-Test:**  
A pre-test is a trial use of a research tool.  
It is done to find weaknesses in tools like questionnaires or scales.

**Research Design:**  
Research design is a systematic plan  
to guide and carry out research work.

**Research Problem:**  
A research problem is a felt need.  
It requires an answer or solution.

**Testing of Hypothesis:**  
Testing of hypothesis means checking  
whether a hypothesis is true or false using facts.
