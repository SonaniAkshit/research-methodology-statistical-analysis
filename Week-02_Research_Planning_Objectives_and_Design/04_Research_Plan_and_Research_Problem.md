## 2.1 Introduction

In Unit 1, we studied the meaning and importance of business research.  
We also learned about types of research and research methods.  
The steps of the business research process were explained.

The research process starts with identifying a problem.  
After that, data is collected.  
Then the data is analyzed and interpreted.  
Finally, a research report is written.

In this unit, we focus on planning the research.  
This includes selecting and clearly defining a research problem.  
It also includes setting research objectives and hypotheses.  
Another important part is designing the research action plan.

This unit explains these topics in detail.  
It also covers related points connected with research problems.  
Hypothesis formulation and testing are also discussed clearly.

## 2.2 Research Problem

Research cannot start without a problem.  
There must be something to study and something to find.  
So, the first step in research is to identify a problem.  
The problem can be practical or theoretical.

The existence of a problem encourages research.  
Research is a repeated search for truth or facts.  
If there is no problem, research cannot move forward.  
The problem gives direction and purpose to research.

In simple words, a problem means a difficulty faced by a researcher.  
This difficulty may occur in theory or in real life.  
Solving this difficulty is the main task of research.

A problem exists when we do not have enough information to answer a question.  
The answer to this question is what research tries to find.

A problem also means a situation where we do not know what to do.  
We may also not know what is true in that situation.  
In daily life, when something is not clear, we say it is problematic.

When a researcher selects a problem, they form a hypothesis.  
A hypothesis is an assumption about what may be true.  
The researcher then collects data or facts to test this assumption.  
After analyzing the data, the researcher decides whether the assumption is true.  
In this way, the question is answered and the problem is solved.

A research problem is usually written in the form of a question.

Some examples are:

- Why is product X more popular than product Y?  
- How can labour productivity be increased?  
- Does better lighting increase productivity?  
- Why is factory A making profits while factory B is facing losses?  
- Is the audio-visual method of teaching more effective than only audio teaching?

All these are researchable questions.  
Research tries to find answers to such questions.

One main research problem can also lead to many sub-questions.  
These sub-questions help in studying the problem in more detail.

Now, we will discuss the points to consider while selecting a research problem.

A research topic can be chosen by an institution or by a researcher.

When an institution selects a topic, it may have many problems to study.  
The institution can be a local body, government, company, or political party.  
For example, the government may want to study rural unemployment.  
It may want to know the results of different actions to solve this problem.  
A business firm may want to study customer demand.  
It may also want to predict future trends.  
This helps in planning marketing, production, and understanding consumer behavior.

A research topic can also be selected by an individual researcher.  
The researcher may choose a topic due to personal interest or curiosity.  
Sometimes, the topic is chosen because very little is known about it.  
The aim may be to gain new knowledge.

A researcher may also study a topic that was researched earlier.  
However, conditions may have changed over time.  
So, the topic needs to be studied again.

In some cases, a researcher may test an old theory again.  
This is done using new data or facts.  
The goal is to check whether the theory is still valid.

A research topic may be general or specific.  
It may be chosen for knowledge or for solving a practical problem.  
Many real-life issues can become research topics.

Some examples are:

- Impact of television on children’s education  
- Performance of regulated agricultural markets  
- Profitability of a firm  
- Impact of imports on the Indian economy  
- Comparison of accounting practices in public and private companies  

### 2.2.1 Sources of Research Problems

If a researcher or research organization already has a problem,  
they can move ahead with the research process.  
If not, they must search for a research problem.

The first place to look is your own mind.  
You need to observe, feel, and think about problems.  
The following sources can help in identifying research problems.

#### 1) Business Problems

A research problem often comes from a real business need.  
This need may be for an answer, a solution, or an improvement.  
It may relate to facilities or technology.

Businesses face many types of problems, such as:

- Business policy problems  
- Operational problems  
- General management problems  
- Functional area problems  

Functional areas include:

- Financial Management  
- Marketing Management  
- Production Management  
- Human Resources Management  

Business research aims to solve management problems.  
It helps managers make better and logical decisions.

#### 2) Day-to-Day Problems

Research problems can come from daily life experiences.  
Everyday situations often create new problems to study.  
This depends on the researcher’s observation and thinking ability.

**Example:**  
A person who travels by city bus daily finds it difficult to get in or out.  
Introducing a queue system helps people board and exit easily.  
This daily problem can become a research problem.

#### 3) Technological Changes

Technology changes very fast.  
New technology creates new problems and new research opportunities.

**Example:**  
Studying the impact of a new machine, process, or technique.

#### 4) Unexplored Areas

Some areas are well researched, while others are not.  
A researcher can identify areas with little or no research.  
Such unexplored or less explored areas can be chosen as research problems.

#### 5) Theory of One’s Own Interest

A researcher may choose a problem from a theory of personal interest.  
In this case, the researcher must understand the theory well.  
They should explore unclear parts or assumptions of the theory.

The aim may be to:

- Recheck the theory  
- Modify the theory  
- Reject the theory based on new findings  

#### 6) Books, Theses, Dissertation Abstracts, Articles

Textbooks, research theses, dissertations, and research journal articles  
are important sources of research problems.  
Special assignments and research reports also help.

These sources often point out areas that need more research.  
Many theses and articles suggest topics for future study.  
Such suggested problems can be useful for new research.

#### 7) Policy Problems

Government policies can have both positive and negative effects.  
These effects can become research problems.

**Examples:**

- Impact of the new industrial policy on industrial development  
- Impact of export and import policy on the balance of payments  
- Impact of SEBI regulations on stock markets  

#### 8) Discussions with Supervisor and Other Knowledgeable Persons

Discussion with a research supervisor can be very helpful.  
Talking to experts or knowledgeable persons in the field also helps.  
Such discussions can guide the researcher in selecting a good problem.

### 2.2.2 Points to be Considered while Selecting a Problem

A researcher may have many topics to choose from.  
The selected topic or problem must meet certain conditions.  
Every research problem should satisfy the following points.

#### 1) Original or Less Explored Topic

The topic should be new or not fully studied.  
Research aims to add new knowledge, not repeat old facts.  
So, the researcher should first review existing literature.

This review helps in three ways:

- It helps the researcher identify a clear research problem  
- It avoids repeating work already done by others  
- It gives information about past research methods and their limits  

#### 2) Significance and Social Usefulness

The problem should be important.  
It should be useful to society in some way.

#### 3) Interest of the Researcher

The topic should be interesting to the researcher.  
It should match the researcher’s interest and ability.

#### 4) Area of Specialization

The problem should belong to the researcher’s area of specialization.  

#### 5) Match with Researcher’s Abilities

The topic should match the researcher’s skills.  
These skills may be already learned or can be learned during research.

#### 6) Proper Size of the Problem

The problem should be large enough for research.  
At the same time, it should be small enough to handle.  
It should be possible to study with available or learnable skills.

#### 7) Clear Focus

The problem should have a clear aim or objective.  

#### 8) Feasibility of the Research

Before selecting the problem, feasibility must be checked.

The researcher should ask:

- Are enough and suitable data available?  
- Is access to organizations and respondents possible?  
- Will organizations and respondents cooperate?  
- What resources are needed and are they available?  
- Is the research possible with available money and manpower?  

#### 9) Time Limit

The research should be completed within the given time limit.  

### 2.2.3 Specification of the Problem

After reviewing all related issues, the problem must be restated clearly.  
It should be written in analytical terms, keeping the solution in mind.

The best way to understand a problem is to discuss it with the people  
who first identified it.  
This helps in knowing how the problem arose.  
It also shows what the people were thinking at that time.

If the problem is stated in a very general way,  
more discussion is needed to understand its true nature.

The research problem must clearly define the researcher’s goal.  
Along with the problem, the research objective should be clearly stated.  
If the goal is not clear, research activities become meaningless.

The first step in defining a research problem is to make it clear and specific.  
There is no perfect method to do this.  
However, R. L. Ackoff gives useful guidance for this process.  
He explains five main components of a research problem.

#### 1) Research Consumer

There must be a person or group facing a difficulty.  
This person may be the researcher himself or herself.  
It may also be a group of researchers.  
In some cases, other people may also be involved.

If the researcher is different from the research consumer,  
then the researcher is also a participant in the problem.

#### 2) Research Consumer’s Objective

The research consumer must want to know something.  
They must have some goal to achieve.  
A person who wants nothing cannot have a problem.

#### 3) Alternative Means to Achieve the Objective

The research consumer must have different ways to reach the objective.  
These ways are called courses of action.  
A course of action may use certain tools or resources.

These tools are called instruments.  
An instrument can be an object, idea, or concept.  
It helps in achieving the objective.

There must be at least two possible ways available.  
If there is no choice between methods,  
then there is no research problem.

#### 4) Doubt in Regard to Selection of Alternatives

Having different options is not enough to create a problem.  
The research consumer must feel doubt about which option to choose.  
If there is no doubt, there is no problem.

Most problems finally come down to comparing options.  
The goal is to find which option works best for the given objective.

#### 5) One or More Environments

A problem must exist in a specific environment.  
A problem may exist in one environment but not in another.  
A change in environment can create or remove a problem.

The research consumer may be unsure about the best method to use.  
This may depend on the environment.

**Examples:**

- Marketing strategies differ in urban, semi-urban, and rural markets  
- Family planning messages differ for educated and illiterate people  

Some problems exist only in one environment.  
Other problems exist in many environments.

Selecting a research topic is only the first step.  
A general topic does not clearly show what data are needed.  
It also does not explain which methods to use or how to organize data.

So, the researcher must clearly define a specific research problem.  
This is done by clearly stating all its components.

A research problem is a basic question.  
Research tries to find an answer or solution to this question.

This main question can be divided into smaller questions.  
These questions should be:

- Simple  
- Clear  
- Limited  
- Based on facts and data  

Defining a problem means narrowing its scope step by step.  
The focus becomes sharper until clear questions are formed.

If you can answer the following questions,  
the research problem is clearly defined.

1) What do you want to know?  
   - What is the problem or question?

2) Why do you want to know?  
   - What is the purpose or objective?

3) How do you want to solve it?  
   - What method will be used?

4) When do you want to solve it?  
   - What is the time limit?

5) Where do you want to solve it?  
   - What is the area or place?

6) Who is the research consumer?  
   - Who will use the results?

A well-defined problem is half solved.
