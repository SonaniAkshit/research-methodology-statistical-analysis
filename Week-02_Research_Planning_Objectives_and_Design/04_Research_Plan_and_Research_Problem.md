## 2.0 Objectives

After studying this unit, you will be able to:

- Select a research problem and identify its sources  
- Define a research problem clearly  
- Specify a research problem in a proper way  
- Explain why research objectives are important  
- Define a hypothesis and classify different types of hypotheses  
- State the criteria of a good hypothesis  
- Test a hypothesis  
- Describe what a research design is  
- List the main components of a research design  
- Distinguish between a pilot study and a pre-test  

## 2.1 Introduction

In Unit 1, we studied the meaning and importance of business research.  
We also learned about types of research and research methods.  
The steps of the business research process were explained.

The research process starts with identifying a problem.  
After that, data is collected.  
Then the data is analyzed and interpreted.  
Finally, a research report is written.

In this unit, we focus on planning the research.  
This includes selecting and clearly defining a research problem.  
It also includes setting research objectives and hypotheses.  
Another important part is designing the research action plan.

This unit explains these topics in detail.  
It also covers related points connected with research problems.  
Hypothesis formulation and testing are also discussed clearly.

## 2.2 Research Problem

Research cannot start without a problem.  
There must be something to study and something to find.  
So, the first step in research is to identify a problem.  
The problem can be practical or theoretical.

The existence of a problem encourages research.  
Research is a repeated search for truth or facts.  
If there is no problem, research cannot move forward.  
The problem gives direction and purpose to research.

In simple words, a problem means a difficulty faced by a researcher.  
This difficulty may occur in theory or in real life.  
Solving this difficulty is the main task of research.

A problem exists when we do not have enough information to answer a question.  
The answer to this question is what research tries to find.

A problem also means a situation where we do not know what to do.  
We may also not know what is true in that situation.  
In daily life, when something is not clear, we say it is problematic.

When a researcher selects a problem, they form a hypothesis.  
A hypothesis is an assumption about what may be true.  
The researcher then collects data or facts to test this assumption.  
After analyzing the data, the researcher decides whether the assumption is true.  
In this way, the question is answered and the problem is solved.

A research problem is usually written in the form of a question.

Some examples are:

- Why is product X more popular than product Y?  
- How can labour productivity be increased?  
- Does better lighting increase productivity?  
- Why is factory A making profits while factory B is facing losses?  
- Is the audio-visual method of teaching more effective than only audio teaching?

All these are researchable questions.  
Research tries to find answers to such questions.

One main research problem can also lead to many sub-questions.  
These sub-questions help in studying the problem in more detail.

Now, we will discuss the points to consider while selecting a research problem.

A research topic can be chosen by an institution or by a researcher.

When an institution selects a topic, it may have many problems to study.  
The institution can be a local body, government, company, or political party.  
For example, the government may want to study rural unemployment.  
It may want to know the results of different actions to solve this problem.  
A business firm may want to study customer demand.  
It may also want to predict future trends.  
This helps in planning marketing, production, and understanding consumer behavior.

A research topic can also be selected by an individual researcher.  
The researcher may choose a topic due to personal interest or curiosity.  
Sometimes, the topic is chosen because very little is known about it.  
The aim may be to gain new knowledge.

A researcher may also study a topic that was researched earlier.  
However, conditions may have changed over time.  
So, the topic needs to be studied again.

In some cases, a researcher may test an old theory again.  
This is done using new data or facts.  
The goal is to check whether the theory is still valid.

A research topic may be general or specific.  
It may be chosen for knowledge or for solving a practical problem.  
Many real-life issues can become research topics.

Some examples are:

- Impact of television on children’s education  
- Performance of regulated agricultural markets  
- Profitability of a firm  
- Impact of imports on the Indian economy  
- Comparison of accounting practices in public and private companies
