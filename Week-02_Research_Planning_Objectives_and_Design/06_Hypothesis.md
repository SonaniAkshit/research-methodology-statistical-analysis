## 2.4 Hypothesis

Research starts with a problem or a felt difficulty.  
The aim of research is to find a solution to this difficulty.

Before starting the research,  
the researcher should suggest possible solutions or explanations.  
These suggested solutions are only assumptions at first.

Such temporary and suggested solutions are called hypotheses.  

A hypothesis is written as a statement.  
It may or may not be the correct solution to the problem.  
Research is done to test these hypotheses.

The main task of research is to check  
whether the hypotheses are true or false.

### 2.4.1 Meaning of Hypothesis

To understand the meaning of a hypothesis,  
let us look at some definitions.

“A hypothesis is a temporary general statement.  
Its truth has to be tested.  
In the early stage, it may be a guess or an idea.  
This idea becomes the base for research or action.”  
— G. A. Lundberg

“A hypothesis is a statement that can be tested  
to check whether it is true or not.”  
— Goode and Hatt

“A hypothesis is a question framed in such a way  
that it can be answered.”  
— Rummel and Ballaine

From these definitions, we can understand that  
a hypothesis is a temporary solution or explanation.  
It may be a guess, assumption, or statement.  
It is based on limited observation and available data.

A hypothesis is used as the starting point of research.  
Its truth must be tested and verified through research.

### 2.4.2 Types of Hypothesis

Hypotheses can be grouped into different types.  
Some common types are explained below.

**i) Explanatory Hypothesis**

This type of hypothesis explains a fact or event.  
It is used when we try to explain why something happened.

Most hypotheses are explanatory in nature.  
They are formed to explain observed facts.

**Examples:**

- Reason for a theft  
- Cause of an accident  
- Explanation of a murder  

**ii) Descriptive Hypothesis**

Sometimes a researcher observes a complex situation.  
The relationships between facts may not be clear.

A descriptive hypothesis describes what is happening.  
It is based on similarities or patterns.  
It explains the cause and effect of a situation.

**Examples:**

- The unemployment rate in a state is above 25%  
- Consumers of locally made products form a large market group  

**iii) Analogical Hypothesis**

This hypothesis is based on similarity between situations.  
It compares one situation with another.

**Example:**

- Families with higher income invest more in long-term investments  

**iv) Working Hypothesis**

Sometimes existing hypotheses cannot explain the facts.  
No new clear hypothesis is available.

In such cases, a temporary hypothesis is formed.  
This helps the research to continue.

This type of hypothesis is called a working hypothesis.  
It is accepted only as a starting point for investigation.

**v) Null Hypothesis**

The null hypothesis is widely used in statistical testing.  
It is written in a negative form.

It is called “null” because it can be rejected.  
It is tested using sample data and written as H₀.

If test results support it, the null hypothesis is accepted.  
If not, it is rejected.

Rejection means the result is not due to chance alone.

**vi) Statistical Hypothesis**

A statistical hypothesis is based on numerical data.  
It is formed using sample information.

These hypotheses are measurable and quantitative.

**Examples:**

- Market share of product X is 70%  
- Average life of a tube light is 2000 hours  

### 2.4.3 Criteria for Workable Hypothesis

A hypothesis guides and controls a research study.  
When a problem is identified, a hypothesis is needed to explain it.

Often, more than one hypothesis may explain the same fact.  
But all hypotheses are not equally good.  
So, we need rules to judge whether a hypothesis is good or bad.

A hypothesis is considered true if it agrees with facts.  
Based on this idea, certain conditions are used  
to judge whether a hypothesis is valid.

These conditions are explained below.

**i) Empirically Verifiable**

A good hypothesis must be testable using facts or data.  
It should be possible to prove it true or false.

If it matches facts, it is true.  
If it does not match facts, it is false.  
This testing using data is part of scientific research.

**ii) Relevant**

A hypothesis must relate directly to the research problem.  
It should help explain the facts being studied.  
If it explains the problem clearly, it is relevant.

**iii) Predictive and Explanatory Power**

A good hypothesis should explain more than one fact.  
It should also help predict other related facts.

If a hypothesis explains many observable facts,  
it has strong explanatory power.

**iv) Base for Deductive Inference**

Research moves from known facts to unknown facts.  
We cannot draw conclusions from something completely unknown.

So, a hypothesis must be based on existing knowledge.  
It should allow the researcher to predict outcomes logically.

**v) Consistency with Established Knowledge**

A new hypothesis should not go against accepted knowledge.  
It should agree with existing laws and theories.

**vi) Simplicity**

A simple hypothesis is better than a complex one.  
If two hypotheses explain facts equally well,  
the simpler one should be chosen.

**vii) Clear, Definite, and Specific**

A hypothesis should be clear and well-defined.  
It should not be vague or confusing.  
Its meaning should be easy to understand.

**viii) Related to Available Techniques**

A hypothesis must be testable using available tools.  
If no method exists to test it, research cannot proceed.

So, the hypothesis should be formed  
only after considering available methods and techniques.

### 2.4.4 Stages in Hypothesis

There are four main stages in forming and testing a hypothesis.

#### Stage 1: Feeling of a Problem

The researcher observes certain facts.  
Through observation and analysis, a problem is identified.  
These observed facts create a need for explanation.

#### Stage 2: Formulation of Hypothesis

At this stage, one or more tentative explanations are formed.  
These are guesses made to explain the observed facts.

Past experience and prior knowledge are important here.  
Without previous knowledge, research becomes very difficult.

#### Stage 3: Deductive Development

In this stage, the researcher uses logical reasoning.  
The hypothesis is treated as a starting point.  
From it, conclusions are logically drawn.

#### Stage 4: Verification or Testing

Here, the researcher checks whether the conclusions are true.  
This is done by comparing them with actual facts.

If the hypothesis matches the facts, it is accepted.  
If it does not match, it is rejected.  
The researcher must then look for a new explanation.

#### Example

Suppose you are riding a scooter to college.  
After some time, the scooter suddenly stops.

You ask yourself why it stopped.  
From past experience, you think the problem could be petrol or spark plug.

You form possible reasons:

- The petrol knob is off  
- There is no petrol in the tank  
- The spark plug is dirty  

Now you test each one.

First, you check the petrol knob.  
If it is off, you turn it on and try to start the scooter.

If it is already on, you check the petrol tank.  
If the tank is empty, you refill it.

If petrol is present, you check the spark plug.  
You clean the spark plug and fix it.

The scooter starts.  
This shows the problem was with the spark plug.  
So, the problem is identified and solved.

### 2.4.5 Testing of Hypothesis

After a hypothesis is formed, it must be tested.  
Testing checks whether the hypothesis is true or false.

The ability to test a hypothesis is very important.  
Testing means comparing the hypothesis with actual facts.

If the hypothesis agrees with facts, it is accepted as true.  
If it does not agree, it is considered false.  
A false hypothesis may be rejected or modified.

Testing of a hypothesis can be of two types:

#### 1) Direct Verification

Direct verification is done through observation or experiments.

- **Observation:**  
  If direct observation shows that the cause exists as expected,  
  the hypothesis is directly verified.

- **Experiment:**  
  If a hypothesis is tested in a laboratory experiment,  
  it is called direct verification by experiment.

#### 2) Indirect Verification

Some hypotheses cannot be tested directly.  
In such cases, indirect verification is used.

Indirect verification involves two steps:

1) Predicting possible results from the hypothesis  
2) Checking whether these predicted results actually occur  

If the predicted results are true,  
the hypothesis is indirectly verified.

Verification can be direct, indirect, or logical.


#### Statistical Testing of Hypothesis

Hypotheses are often tested using statistical methods.  
These methods use sample data to make decisions.

The assumption to be tested is called the null hypothesis (H₀).  
It is tested against an alternative hypothesis (H₁).

Statistical testing follows these steps:

A) Select a sample and collect data  
B) Convert data into statistical values like mean or proportion  
C) Formulate hypotheses  
D) Choose a suitable test such as t-test or Z-test  
E) Perform calculations  
F) Decide whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis  

Detailed study of hypothesis testing is covered in later units.

### 2.4.6 Uses of Hypothesis

If a clear scientific hypothesis is framed,  
a large part of the research work is already done.

The main uses of a hypothesis are given below.

i) It provides a starting point for research  
ii) It shows the direction in which research should move  
iii) It helps in selecting and collecting relevant facts  
iv) It helps in explaining observed facts  
v) It helps in drawing clear conclusions  
vi) It helps in testing existing theories  
vii) It forms a base for future knowledge
