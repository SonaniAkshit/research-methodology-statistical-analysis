## 2.3 Formulation of Objectives

After selecting and clearly defining the research problem,  
the next step is to set the research objectives.

Research is not done without a purpose.  
It is carried out to achieve something specific.  
So, research is a goal-oriented activity.

The researcher must clearly identify the goals of the study.  
These goals give proper direction to the research.  
That is why formulating research objectives is very important.

Once the objectives are clearly stated,  
all research activities focus on achieving them.

**Example:**  
Suppose we want to study a regulated agricultural market in a town.  
The purpose is to check whether it is meeting its objectives.

For this study, we may collect data such as:

- Arrival of different agricultural products  
- Sources and use of funds  
- Facilities provided in the market  
- Opinions of users  

If the objectives are clear,  
it becomes easier to decide:

- What data to collect  
- From where to collect data  
- How to collect data  
- How to analyze the data  

Therefore, research objectives must be:

- Clear  
- Specific  
- Definite
