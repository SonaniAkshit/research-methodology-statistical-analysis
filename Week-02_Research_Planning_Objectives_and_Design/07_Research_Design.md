## 2.5 Research Design

Research design is also called a research outline, plan, or blueprint.

According to Fred N. Kerlinger,  
research design is the plan, structure, and strategy of a study.  
It is prepared to answer research questions and control variations.

The **plan** includes all steps of the research.  
This starts from writing hypotheses and ends with data analysis.

The **structure** is the framework of the study.  
It shows how different variables are organized and related.

The **strategy** includes the methods used.  
These methods are for collecting and analyzing data.

At the beginning, the research design is usually unclear and flexible.  
It changes as the research moves forward.  
As understanding improves, the design is modified.

Preparing the design involves many decisions, such as:

- What to study  
- Why to study  
- Where to study  
- When to study  
- Who to study  
- How to study  

According to Pauline V. Young,  
research design is the logical and systematic planning of research.

According to Reger E. Kirk,  
research design explains how data should be collected and analyzed.

Research must fit within available time, money, energy, and data.  
There is no single perfect research design.

A research design is a practical choice.  
It is shaped by real-life limitations and conditions.

### 2.5.1 Functions of Research Design

No matter which research design is chosen,  
it performs some important functions.

These functions are explained below.

i) It gives a clear plan for studying research questions  

ii) It sets the limits of the research work  
   and helps the researcher focus in one direction  

iii) It helps the researcher foresee possible problems  
   during the research process  

iv) It helps the researcher find answers  
   to different types of research questions  

A research design has many connected parts.  
These parts depend on each other.

The researcher has to make decisions about:

- Definitions  
- Methods  
- Techniques  
- Procedures  
- Time  
- Cost  
- Administrative aspects  

### 2.5.2 Components of a Research Design

A research design is a clear plan of action.  
After selecting a research problem,  
the next step is to carry out the study.

For this, the researcher must decide many things, such as:

- How to conduct the study  
- What is the scope of the study  
- What are the sources of data  
- What method of enquiry will be used  
- What is the time frame  
- How data will be recorded  
- How data will be analyzed  
- What tools and techniques will be used  
- What manpower and organization are needed  
- What resources are required  

All these decisions must be made at the beginning.  
This gives clarity about the research work.

It is similar to preparing a building plan  
before constructing a building.

According to P. V. Young,  
all decisions about what, where, when, how much,  
and by what means form the study design.

Usually, a research design includes  
the following components:

#### Components of a Research Design

**1) Need for the Study**

This explains why the study is required.  
It shows the importance of the study.  
It also explains how the study is useful and relevant.

**2) Review of Previous Studies**

This involves studying earlier research on the same topic.  
The researcher understands what others have already done.  
Gaps in earlier studies are identified.  
This helps in justifying the present study.

**3) Statement of Problem**

The research problem should be stated clearly.  
A suitable title should be given to the study.

**4) Objectives of Study**

This explains the purpose of the study.  
It clearly states what the researcher wants to achieve.

Objectives should be:

- Clear  
- Specific  
- Focused  

They should not be vague.

**5) Formulation of Hypothesis**

Possible answers or outcomes are identified.  
These are framed as hypotheses.  
They should be written in a form that can be tested.

**6) Operational Definitions**

If new or uncommon terms are used,  
they must be clearly defined.

Even common terms must be defined  
if they are used in a special way in the study.

**7) Scope of the Study**

The scope shows the limits of the study.  
It explains what is included and what is excluded.

Scope includes:

- Geographical area to be covered  
- Subject content to be covered  
- Time period to be covered  

**Geographical Scope:**  
Decides the area of study, such as a city, state, or whole country.

**Content Scope:**  
Decides which aspects of the topic will be studied  
and which aspects will not be included.

**Time Scope:**  
Decides the time period of the study.  
The study may be for a single point in time  
or for a long period, such as from 1991 to 2003.

**8) Sources of Data**

This is an important part of research design.  
The researcher must decide where data will come from.

There are two main sources of data:

- **Primary sources:** Data collected directly from the field  
- **Secondary sources:** Data taken from documents and records  

Data from primary sources are called **primary data**.  
Data from secondary sources are called **secondary data**.

The researcher must decide whether to use:

- Only primary data  
- Only secondary data  
- Both primary and secondary data  

**9) Method of Collection**

After deciding data sources,  
the researcher must choose the method of data collection.

The main methods are:

- Census method  
- Sampling method  

This decision depends on:

- Nature of the study  
- Purpose of the study  
- Scope of the study  
- Time available  
- Financial resources  

**10) Tools and Techniques**

The researcher must decide the tools for data collection.

Common tools include:

- Observation  
- Interview  
- Survey  
- Schedule  
- Questionnaire  

These tools must be properly prepared before use.

**11) Sampling Design**

If the study uses a sample,  
the researcher must decide:

- Sampling technique  
- Sample size  
- Method of selecting the sample  

**12) Data Analysis**

The researcher must plan how data will be processed.  
It must be decided how the data will be analyzed.

This includes deciding:

- Simple or advanced statistical methods  
- Techniques for testing hypotheses  

Proper planning helps avoid mistakes during data collection.

**13) Presentation of Results**

The researcher must decide how to present the findings.

This includes:

- Number of chapters  
- Order of chapters  
- Purpose and title of each chapter  

This arrangement is called **chapterisation**.

**14) Time Estimates**

The researcher must decide the time available for the study.  
Most research studies are time-bound.

Time should be divided among activities such as:

- Research design preparation  
- Questionnaire preparation  
- Data collection  
- Data analysis  
- Report writing  

Each activity must be completed within the given time.

**15) Financial Budget**

The research design must consider costs involved.

Expenses may include:

- Salaries  
- Printing and stationery  
- Postage and telephone  
- Computer and secretarial help  

The researcher must also consider available funds.

**16) Administration of the Enquiry**

This explains how the research will be carried out.

It includes:

- Who will do which work  
- When each activity will be done  
- Training research staff  
- Assigning duties  
- Coordinating activities  

The entire study must be completed as per the schedule.

Research designs are guidelines, not fixed rules.  
As the study progresses, changes may be needed.

New situations and information may arise.  
So, the research design should be flexible.

Based on the research method,  
designs may be called:

- Survey design  
- Case study design  
- Observation design  
- Experimental design
