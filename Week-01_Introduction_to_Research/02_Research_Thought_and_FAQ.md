## 1.5 Inductive and Deductive Logic

A rational person does not accept any statement without **logical reasoning or factual verification**. In research, after data or facts are collected, processed, and analysed, broad conclusions or generalisations are drawn. Research provides a logical framework for studying a subject. It helps in identifying relationships between different variables and also explains **cause-and-effect relationships**. Through systematic research, both induction and deduction are used to reach conclusions.

**Induction** is a method of reasoning in which general conclusions are drawn from specific observations. It moves from particular facts to a general rule or principle. In other words, induction goes from what is observed to what is not yet observed. It involves two main steps: **observation** and **generalisation**.

For example, if we observe in many situations that people buy less when prices increase, we can form the general statement:
**“When price increases, demand falls.”**

**Deduction**, on the other hand, is a method of reasoning in which a **specific conclusion** is drawn from a **general rule**. It moves from a general statement to a particular case.

For example:

* **All men are mortal** is a general rule.
  Ranjit is a man.
  Therefore, it can be concluded that **Ranjit is mortal**.

* **All M.Com. degree holders are eligible for a Ph.D. in Commerce** is a general statement.
  Praneeth is an M.Com. degree holder.
  Therefore, it can be concluded that **Praneeth is eligible for a Ph.D. in Commerce**.

Empirical studies are very useful because they help in both **induction and deduction**. Research allows us to develop theories and principles and also to form general conclusions. Both induction and deduction help in the growth and acquisition of knowledge.
