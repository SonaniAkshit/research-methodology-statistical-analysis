## 1.5 Inductive and Deductive Logic

A rational person does not accept any statement without **logical reasoning or factual verification**. In research, after data or facts are collected, processed, and analysed, broad conclusions or generalisations are drawn. Research provides a logical framework for studying a subject. It helps in identifying relationships between different variables and also explains **cause-and-effect relationships**. Through systematic research, both induction and deduction are used to reach conclusions.

**Induction** is a method of reasoning in which general conclusions are drawn from specific observations. It moves from particular facts to a general rule or principle. In other words, induction goes from what is observed to what is not yet observed. It involves two main steps: **observation** and **generalisation**.

For example, if we observe in many situations that people buy less when prices increase, we can form the general statement:
**“When price increases, demand falls.”**

**Deduction**, on the other hand, is a method of reasoning in which a **specific conclusion** is drawn from a **general rule**. It moves from a general statement to a particular case.

For example:

* **All men are mortal** is a general rule.
  Ranjit is a man.
  Therefore, it can be concluded that **Ranjit is mortal**.

* **All M.Com. degree holders are eligible for a Ph.D. in Commerce** is a general statement.
  Praneeth is an M.Com. degree holder.
  Therefore, it can be concluded that **Praneeth is eligible for a Ph.D. in Commerce**.

Empirical studies are very useful because they help in both **induction and deduction**. Research allows us to develop theories and principles and also to form general conclusions. Both induction and deduction help in the growth and acquisition of knowledge.

## 1.6 Significance of Research in Business

Research is a **systematic and in-depth study** carried out to find a solution to a problem or to answer a question. It involves collecting, organising, presenting, analysing, and interpreting relevant data and information. Research is also a planned effort to discover important facts and relationships. It may include careful investigation or experimentation and can lead to new discoveries or innovations.

Any form of research adds to knowledge, and this knowledge can be useful to different people in different ways. In the business context, research plays an important role in helping organisations and managers make better decisions. Let us now examine why research is needed in business and how it benefits business organisations and their managers.

**i)** Industrial and economic activities have grown very large in scale. Modern business organisations handle huge amounts of capital and affect the lives of many people. Because of this, the **trial-and-error method is risky and costly**. Business decisions must be quick, accurate, timely, and based on facts rather than guesses. In this situation, research plays an important role. Research helps managers take **fast and objective decisions** based on real data and analysis.

**ii)** Research is a **fact-finding process** and strongly influences business decisions. Management always wants to choose the best possible course of action to achieve organisational goals. Research provides reliable facts and data that support decision making and helps managers compare different options and select the most effective one.

**iii)** Many business problems are now analysed using **quantitative methods**, such as operations research, with good results. Research on management problems often leads to logical and well-reasoned conclusions. These conclusions help decision makers choose suitable actions or solutions to business problems.

**iv)** Research plays an important role in **identifying new projects**, checking their **feasibility**, and supporting their **successful implementation**. It helps management decide whether a project is practical, profitable, and worth undertaking.

**v)** Research helps management perform its key functions such as **planning, forecasting, coordinating, motivating, controlling, and evaluating** in an effective manner. Decisions based on research are more systematic and reliable.

**vi)** Research improves the ability of managers to **think logically, analyse data, evaluate options, and interpret business conditions**. This helps in understanding the business environment and different business alternatives, which is useful for framing sound **business policies and strategies**.

**vii)** Research and Development (R&D) supports **discovery and invention**. In business, developing new products, improving existing products, finding new uses, and exploring new markets is a continuous process, and research makes this possible.

**viii)** Research plays an important role in all functional areas of business such as **production, finance, human resource management, and marketing**. It helps in understanding relationships within each function and also the links between different functional areas.

**ix)** Research is essential in the **production area**. It supports product development, better production methods, new technologies, cost reduction, quality improvement, work simplification, performance improvement, and process improvement.

**x)** The **purchase or materials department** uses research to develop suitable policies related to **where to buy, when to buy, how much to buy, and at what price to buy**.

**xi)** The marketing function is closely connected with production. **Market research and marketing research** provide important information that affects inventory and production levels. Marketing research studies market problems and opportunities, customer preferences, sales forecasting, effectiveness of advertising, product distribution, and after-sales service.

**xii)** In **financial management**, it is important to maintain liquidity and profitability through proper management of funds and assets. Decisions related to capital structure, matching cash inflows and outflows, cash flow forecasting, cost control, and pricing require research and analysis. Banks and other financial institutions also set up research departments to collect and analyse data for internal use and to study the economic conditions of businesses and individuals.

**xiii)** In **human resource management**, personnel policies should be based on research. Employee motivation depends on their needs and how well those needs are satisfied. An effective HR manager identifies employee needs and designs policies to meet them, so employees are motivated to contribute their best to organisational goals. Activities such as job design, job analysis, job assignment, and work scheduling must be based on careful investigation and analysis.

**xiv)** Finally, business research is essential to continuously update **attitudes, strategies, products, goals, methods, and technology** in line with changes in the business environment.

## 1.7 Types of Research

Research can be classified into different types to make the concept easier to understand. There are many bases for classification, such as **nature of data, field of knowledge, scope of study, place of investigation, method used, and time period**.

Depending on the basis chosen, research can fall into different categories. A single research study may belong to **more than one type at the same time**, so some overlap is natural. It is important to remember that good research usually uses **multiple types, methods, and techniques**. Because of this, a strict or rigid classification is not possible.

The following classification is only an attempt to group research into different types.

**i) According to the Branch of Knowledge**

  Broadly, branches of knowledge can be divided into two groups:

  **a) Life and Physical Sciences**
  These include subjects such as Botany, Zoology, Physics, and Chemistry.

  **b) Social Sciences**
  These include subjects such as Political Science, Public Administration, Economics, Sociology, Commerce, and Management.

  Research conducted in these areas is generally called **life and physical science research** and **social science research**.

  Business education mainly includes **Commerce and Management**, which are part of the social sciences. **Business research** is a broad term that covers many related areas.

  Business research includes studies in:

  * Management
  * Production
  * Personnel (Human Resources)
  * Finance
  * Accounting
  * Marketing
  * Business Policy
  * Business History

  Research carried out in these fields is known as **management research, production research, personnel research, financial management research, accounting research, marketing research**, and so on.

Management research deals with the different functions of management such as **planning, organising, staffing, communication, coordination, motivation, and control**. Many well-known motivational theories are the result of management research.

Production research, also called **manufacturing research**, focuses mainly on **materials, machines, and equipment**, rather than human factors. It includes finding new and better methods of production, developing new technologies, reducing costs, and improving product quality.

Personnel management research covers both simple and complex problems related to **human resources**. It focuses on human aspects of business such as personnel policies, job requirements, job evaluation, recruitment, selection, placement, training and development, promotion and transfer, employee morale and attitudes, wage and salary administration, and industrial relations. Basic research in this area is very important because human behaviour directly affects organisational behaviour and productivity.

Research in **financial management** covers areas such as financial institutions, financial instruments like shares and debentures, financial markets including capital market, money market, primary market, and secondary market, and financial services such as merchant banking, discounting, and factoring. It also includes financial analysis like investment analysis, ratio analysis, and funds flow or cash flow analysis.

**Accounting research,** though limited in scope, is a **very important area** of business management. Accounting information is used to prepare reports for management, shareholders, investors, tax authorities, regulatory bodies, and other interested parties. Areas of accounting research include inventory valuation, depreciation methods, generally accepted accounting principles, accounting standards, and corporate reporting.

**Marketing research** deals with problems related to **product development and distribution**, marketing institutions, marketing policies and practices, consumer behaviour, advertising and sales promotion, sales management, and after-sales service. It is one of the most popular and well-developed areas of research. Marketing research includes studies on market potential, sales forecasting, product testing, sales analysis, market surveys, test marketing, consumer behaviour, and marketing information systems.

**Business policy research** focuses on issues that have **policy implications**. The findings of such research are used as a basis for formulating and implementing business policies.

**Business history research** studies past business activities. For example, it may examine how trade and commerce were carried out during the Mughal period.

**ii) According to the Nature of Data**

  Research can be broadly classified into **quantitative research** and **qualitative (non-quantitative) research**.

  **Quantitative research** is based on variables that can be measured and expressed in numbers. It focuses on quantifying the problem being studied. Since it uses numerical data, it is more objective and widely used.

  **Qualitative research** is based on attributes such as motives, opinions, attitudes, preferences, behaviour, and feelings. It depends on subjective assessment, and the findings are influenced by the researcher’s understanding and interpretation.

**iii) According to the Coverage**

  Based on the number of units studied, research can be classified as **macro study** or **micro study**.

  A **macro study** examines the entire population or system.
  A **micro study** focuses on a specific part of the whole.

  For example, a study on working capital management in all State Road Transport Corporations in India is a macro study, whereas a study limited to the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation is a micro study.

**iv) According to Utility or Application**

  Based on how the research findings are used, research can be classified into **basic research** and **applied research**.

  **Basic research**, also known as pure, theoretical, or fundamental research, aims at expanding knowledge. It does not focus on solving immediate practical problems and is not carried out for any specific organisation.

  **Applied research**, also called action research, focuses on solving specific problems faced by organisations or sponsoring agencies. Its main purpose is to provide practical solutions.

**v) According to the Place Where Research Is Carried Out**

  Based on the location or source from which data is collected, research can be classified into the following types:

  **a) Field studies or field experiments**
  These are conducted in real-life situations where the actual activities take place.

  **b) Laboratory studies or laboratory experiments**
  These are conducted in controlled environments where conditions can be carefully managed.

  **c) Library studies or documentary research**
  These are based on existing records, documents, books, reports, and published data.

**vi) According to the Research Methods Used**

  Based on the method used to conduct the study, research can be classified as:

  **a) Survey research**
  **b) Observation research**
  **c) Case research**
  **d) Experimental research**
  **e) Historical research**
  **f) Comparative research**

**vii) According to the Time Frame**

  Based on the time period covered in the study, research can be classified as:

  **a) One-time or single-period research**
  This type of research is conducted at one point in time or for a short period, such as one year. Most sample studies and diagnostic studies fall under this category.

  **b) Longitudinal research**
  This type of research is conducted over a long period, covering several years or multiple time periods. It is also known as time-series analysis.
  For example, a study on industrial development during different Five-Year Plans in India.

**viii) According to the Purpose of the Study**

  Research can also be classified based on the aim or objective of the study, such as describing, analysing, evaluating, or exploring a subject. Accordingly, studies are classified as:

  **a) Descriptive study**
  The main purpose of descriptive research is to describe a person, situation, institution, or event as it exists. These studies are mainly fact-finding in nature.

  **b) Analytical study**
  In analytical research, the researcher uses already available data and analyses it to critically examine the subject. These are usually ex-post facto or post-mortem studies.

  **c) Evaluation study**
  This type of study is conducted to assess the impact or effectiveness of an event, decision, project, or investment.

  **d) Exploratory study**
  When very little information is available on a topic, an exploratory study is conducted to gain more understanding. It helps in defining the problem and deciding the methods of study. Such studies are also called exploratory or formulative studies.
