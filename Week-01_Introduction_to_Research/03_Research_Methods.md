## 1.8 Methods of Research

At the end of a research study, the researcher must answer the questions raised at the beginning. To do this, the researcher collects and examines relevant data and information as evidence. The procedures used to collect this data are called **methods of research** or **research approaches**. These are the broad methods used for data collection.

The main methods of research are:

1. Survey Method
2. Observation Method
3. Case Method
4. Experimental Method
5. Historical Method
6. Comparative Method

Each of these methods is explained briefly in the following sections.

### 1.8.1 Survey Method

The word **survey** means to observe, examine, study, or systematically investigate something. The survey method is used to study both **large and small populations**. It is mainly a **fact-finding method** and is commonly used to study real-life or empirical problems. A survey involves careful examination to collect information about a particular condition or how widespread it is.

Examples of surveys include **marketing surveys, household surveys, and the All India Rural Credit Survey**.

Survey research is one of the most popular methods in social science research. With the development of better sampling techniques, survey research has grown as a separate research activity. Today, **sample surveys** are widely used, and in many cases, the term survey itself refers to a sample survey.

Some definitions of survey research are given below:

According to Black and Champion, survey research is the **procedure of collecting information about a large group of people by studying only a small selected group**.

Fred N. Kerlinger defined survey research as the **study of samples taken from a population to understand the distribution, occurrence, and relationships of social and psychological variables**.

In survey research, data can be collected using different methods such as **observation, personal interviews, mailed questionnaires, schedules, and telephone enquiries**.

### Features of Survey Method

The important features of the survey method are as follows:

**i)** It is a **field study** because it is conducted in a natural or real-life setting.

**ii)** It collects responses **directly from respondents** or from people who have proper knowledge about the problem being studied.

**iii)** It usually gathers information from a **large population**.

**iv)** A survey covers a **specific geographical area**, such as a village, city, or district.

**v)** Every survey is carried out within a **fixed time period**.

**vi)** A survey may be:

  * **Extensive**, covering a large sample, or
  * **Intensive**, covering a small sample but involving detailed and in-depth study.

**vii)** Survey research is best suited for collecting information on **personal details, socio-economic conditions, beliefs, attitudes, and opinions**.

Survey research is not a simple clerical task of collecting facts and figures. It requires proper research knowledge and skill. A good survey researcher must understand **sampling methods, questionnaire or schedule design, interviewing techniques**, and other technical aspects. The quality of survey results depends on **careful planning, proper sampling, reliable data, and correct analysis and interpretation** of the data.

### 1.8.2 Observation Method

Observation means **watching or seeing** something carefully. It is not a casual or random activity, but a **systematic and planned process**. Observation can be defined as **systematically watching a specific phenomenon in its natural setting to collect information for a particular study**.

Observation is an important **scientific method of enquiry**. It may involve observing a person, an event, a situation, or an incident. The knowledge in many sciences such as **biology, physiology, astronomy, sociology, psychology, and anthropology** has been developed over centuries through systematic observation.

Observation is also very useful in **social and business sciences** for collecting information and forming concepts.
For example:

* Studying the lifestyle of tribal communities
* Observing how marketing activities take place in regulated markets
* Understanding investment activities in stock exchange markets
* Observing proceedings in the Indian Parliament or state assemblies
* Studying how offices are managed in public or private sector organisations
* Analysing the behaviour of political leaders
* Observing traffic jams in Delhi during peak hours

### Features of Observation Method

Observation as a method of data collection has the following features:

**i)** Observation involves not only **seeing**, but also **hearing and understanding** what is happening.

**ii)** It is both a **physical and mental activity**. The observer sees many things, but focuses only on the information that is relevant to the research problem.

**iii)** Observation records behaviour in its **natural social environment**, where it actually occurs.

**iv)** Observation is **selective**. The researcher does not observe everything, but chooses what to observe based on the nature, scope, and objectives of the study.

**v)** Observation is **purposeful**, not casual. It is done with a clear objective related to the study.

**vi)** The researcher first observes the phenomenon and then **collects and organises the data**.

Observation can be classified in different ways based on **setting, method, and the role of the observer**.

According to the **setting**, observation may be:

* **Observation in a natural setting**, such as watching live telecasts of Parliament proceedings, observing from the visitors’ gallery, or studying election campaigns in India through public meetings.
* **Observation in an artificially created setting**, such as business games or treadmill tests.

According to the **mode of observation**, it can be:

* **Direct or personal observation**, where the researcher personally observes the event as it happens.
* **Indirect or mechanical observation**, where observation is done using devices like audio recordings, audio-visual aids, photographs, or videos.

According to the **role of the observer**, observation may be:

* **Participant observation**, where the researcher takes part in the activity while observing it.
  For example, studying the lifestyle and customs of tribal communities by living with them.
* **Non-participant observation**, where the researcher observes from outside without taking part, acting only as an onlooker.

The observation method is useful for many types of research, such as studying **human behaviour, group behaviour, lifestyles, customs and traditions, interpersonal relationships, group dynamics, crowd behaviour, leadership and management styles, dressing patterns across seasons, behaviour of animals and birds, layout of stores or factories, residential areas, and the conduct of events like meetings, conferences, or sports events such as the Afro-Asian Games**.

### 1.8.3 Case Method

The case method is borrowed from **medical science**. Just as a doctor studies a patient in detail to diagnose a disease and suggest treatment, the case method involves an **intensive study of a unit** to identify problems and suggest solutions.

In this method, a **firm, organisation, or unit** is studied deeply to understand its problems, special features, and differences. It is an **in-depth and detailed study** of a particular unit or problem. A case study may focus on a firm, an industry, a social group, an incident, a process, a programme, an institution, or any other social unit.

According to P. V. Young, a **case study is a comprehensive study of a social unit**, which may be a person, group, institution, district, or community.

The case study method is one of the most popular research methods. Its main aim is to study **everything about one case**, rather than a little about many cases. It examines the complex factors involved in a situation to identify the causes behind them. A case study describes a case by highlighting its special, typical, or extreme features.

This method helps in collecting detailed information about the unit being studied and is especially useful for **diagnostic and problem-solving purposes**.

### 1.8.4 Experimental Method

Experimentation is a basic tool used in physical sciences such as **Physics and Chemistry** to establish **cause-and-effect relationships** and to test conclusions. Today, this method is also widely used in social sciences like **Psychology and Sociology**.

The experimental method is a research process used to study cause-and-effect relationships under **controlled conditions**. It examines how a **dependent variable** is affected by changes in an **independent variable**, while keeping other related variables constant. In experiments, the researcher deliberately changes the independent variable and measures its effect on the dependent variable.

### Main Features of Experimental Method

**i)** Isolation and control of variables to observe their effects clearly.
**ii)** Replication of experiments, meaning the experiment can be repeated under similar conditions.
**iii)** Use of **quantitative measurement** to record results.
**iv)** Precise identification of cause-and-effect relationships.

### Types of Experiments

**a) Natural or uncontrolled experiments**
  These occur naturally and mainly involve observation, as seen in fields like astronomy.

**b) Field experiments**
  These are most suitable for social sciences. A field experiment is conducted in a real-life setting where one or more independent variables are changed under controlled conditions, as far as the situation allows.
  (Definition by Fred N. Kerlinger)

**c) Laboratory experiments**
  These are conducted in controlled laboratory conditions and are mainly used in physical sciences.

A **laboratory experiment** is a research study in which the influence of almost all irrelevant independent variables is kept to a minimum. This is achieved by conducting the research in a controlled physical environment, away from normal day-to-day life, and by carefully manipulating one or more independent variables under strict and well-defined conditions.
(Fred N. Kerlinger)

The difference between **field experiments** and **laboratory experiments** is not very rigid. It is mainly a difference in the level of control. Laboratory experiments provide **maximum control** over variables, while field experiments are carried out in real-life situations and therefore involve **less control**.

### 1.8.5 Historical Method

When research is conducted using **past data**, it is called the **historical method**. In a way, most research has a historical element because it often depends on data and observations recorded in the past. Problems based on **historical records, documents, relics, or time-based data** can be effectively studied using this method.

Historical research relies on past events and data, which cannot be repeated. Therefore, it is a **post-facto analysis**, meaning the researcher studies events after they have already occurred. This method is commonly used by historians, philosophers, social psychologists, literary scholars, and social scientists.

Historical research involves a **careful and critical study of past events, experiences, and developments**. It includes checking the reliability and accuracy of historical sources and interpreting the evidence after careful evaluation. The historical method, also known as **historiography**, is different from other research methods because its subject matter is the **past**, which cannot be directly observed or experimented upon.

### 1.8.6 Comparative Method

The **comparative method** is also known as the **evolutionary method** or **genetic method**. This term comes from disciplines that are traditionally called **comparative sciences**, such as comparative philology, comparative anatomy, comparative physiology, comparative psychology, and comparative religion. The research approach used in these subjects came to be known as the comparative method.

Over time, this method was increasingly used to study **evolution and development**, so it was also called the evolutionary method. It is used to trace the **origin and development** of human beings, their customs, institutions, innovations, and the stages of their evolution. When this method is used to study how things develop over time, it is also called the **genetic method**.

Comparative philology was one of the first fields to use this method. Different languages were compared to trace their historical development by studying similarities and differences. Darwin’s work *Origin of Species* is a classic example of the evolutionary method applied in comparative anatomy.

The theory of biological evolution is based on the evolutionary method. This method is not limited to plants and animals. It can also be applied to **social customs, social institutions, human behaviour, ideas and values, geological formations, chemical elements, and even the history of the solar system**.

In research, the term comparative method is used in a **limited sense** to mean the evolutionary method. Simply calling it a “method of comparison” is not accurate, because comparison is a part of **all scientific methods**. Every scientific method involves comparison in some form, whether in classification or analysis. Therefore, in a broader sense, all research methods are comparative.

## 1.9 Difficulties in Business Research

In India, researchers in general, and business researchers in particular, face many problems. These difficulties are more serious in the case of **empirical research**. Some of the major problems are listed below:

**i)** There is a lack of proper **scientific training in business research methods**. Many researchers start research without a clear understanding of research methodology. Systematic training in research methods is essential.

**ii)** There is a shortage of **qualified researchers and experienced research supervisors**. Because of this, research findings often fail to reflect real business situations.

**iii)** Many business organisations are **not research-oriented**. They believe that spending money on research is a waste of resources and therefore do not encourage research activities.

**iv)** Although many medium and large organisations have **Research and Development (R&D) departments**, top management often does not seriously implement the findings of these departments.

**v)** Small organisations, which form a large part of the economy, **cannot afford R&D departments**. Even hiring external consultants is costly for them, so they do not use research to solve business problems.

**vi)** Many decision makers rely on **customs, traditions, and routine practices** instead of research. They feel that research has little practical value in managing business activities.

**vii)** There is **poor interaction between universities, business organisations, government departments, and research institutions**. Stronger industry–academia collaboration is needed so that academics study real problems and practitioners can use research results.

**viii)** Business organisations consider their information **highly confidential**. Except for public sector units, most private organisations are unwilling to share data with researchers.

**ix)** Even when research is conducted, studies often **overlap and get duplicated** due to lack of coordination between departments within a university and among different universities.

**x) Lack of funds** is a major problem. Due to limited financial resources, many university departments hesitate to undertake research projects.

**xi)** Many places have **poor library facilities**, which forces researchers to spend a lot of time and effort searching for relevant books, journals, and data.

**xii)** Researchers often face a lack of **computer and secretarial support**. Because of this, they take more time to complete their research work.

**xiii)** There is a problem of **delayed publication of data**. Updated data is not easily available from published sources or government agencies. Usually, there is a time gap of two to three years, which makes the data less useful.

**xiv)** Social and managerial research deals with **human behaviour**, which is complex. Ensuring accurate observation, data collection, and valid conclusions is difficult. Proper conceptualisation of these aspects is a major challenge.

**xv)** There is **no clear code of conduct** for researchers. There is a need to develop ethical guidelines to educate researchers about honesty, confidentiality, and responsible research practices.

In spite of all these problems, business organisations cannot avoid research. In a rapidly changing environment, an enterprise must continuously update its **attitudes, strategies, products, and technology** through ongoing research in order to survive and remain competitive.

## 1.10 Business Research Process

In general terms, the **research process is similar in all fields**, whether it is business research, agricultural research, or educational research. Some changes may be required depending on the specific area of study, but the basic process remains the same.

The business research process involves three main stages:

* **Planning** the research activity
* **Executing** the research plan
* **Consolidating and reporting** the results

The major activities involved in the research process are listed below:

**i)** Selection of a research problem or a researchable area
**ii)** Gaining familiarity with existing theories, knowledge, and previous work related to the problem
**iii)** Clear definition and specification of the research problem
**iv)** Formulation of research hypotheses or at least clear research objectives
**v)** Identification of data sources
**vi)** Designing data collection tools such as questionnaires, schedules, and scales
**vii)** Pre-testing these tools and making necessary revisions
**viii)** Actual collection of data through methods like surveys, observation, and interviews
**ix)** Processing and analysing the collected data
**x)** Interpreting the data and preparing the final research report

These steps are explained in detail in later units. Specifically:

* Steps **(i) to (iv)** are covered in Unit 2
* Steps **(v) to (viii)** are covered in Units 3, 4, and 5
* Data processing and presentation in step **(ix)** are discussed in Units 6 and 7
* Data analysis tools and techniques related to step **(ix)** are explained in Units 8 to 17
* Interpretation in step **(x)** is discussed in Unit 18
* Reporting is covered in Unit 19

Therefore, these steps are only briefly introduced here and not explained in detail in this unit.

## 1.11 Let Us Sum Up

Research is an essential part of systematic knowledge. It is a planned and organised investigation aimed at finding answers to problems and discovering facts or truth. The term **science** can be understood in two ways: as an organised body of knowledge and as a method of gaining knowledge. All sciences involve knowledge, but not all knowledge can be called science.

Empirical studies are very important because they lead to **induction and deduction**. Induction involves drawing general conclusions from specific facts, while deduction involves applying general rules to specific cases.

Research is extremely useful for business organisations and managers. It supports **timely and objective decision making**, helps solve business problems, and provides answers to important business questions. Research is applied in many functional areas such as **marketing, personnel, production management, financial management, and accounting**.

For better understanding, research can be classified into different types based on factors such as **branch of knowledge, nature of data, coverage, application, place of study, research methods, and time frame**.

Research must provide answers to the questions raised at the beginning of the study. To do this, the problem must be investigated and relevant data must be collected. The procedures used to collect data are called **methods of research**. The main research methods are **survey, observation, case study, experimental, historical, and comparative methods**.

A **survey** is a fact-finding study conducted in a natural setting by collecting information from people who know about the problem. **Observation** involves systematic watching of a phenomenon in its natural environment. A **case study** is a detailed and in-depth study of a single unit. **Experimentation** is used to study cause-and-effect relationships under controlled conditions. **Historical research** is based on past data and events and is therefore post-facto in nature. The **comparative method** is an evolutionary approach used to study similarities, differences, and development over time.

Business researchers in India face many difficulties such as **lack of proper research training, shortage of skilled researchers and supervisors, limited support for research from business organisations, inability of small firms to maintain R&D departments, weak industry–academic interaction, funding shortages, poor library facilities, and delayed availability of published data**.

The business research process involves several steps, including **selecting a research problem, reviewing previous studies, clearly defining the problem, formulating hypotheses or objectives, identifying data sources, designing and pre-testing data collection tools, collecting data, analysing and processing data, and finally interpreting the results and preparing the research report**.
