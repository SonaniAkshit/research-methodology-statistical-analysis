## 1.8 Methods of Research

At the end of a research study, the researcher must answer the questions raised at the beginning. To do this, the researcher collects and examines relevant data and information as evidence. The procedures used to collect this data are called **methods of research** or **research approaches**. These are the broad methods used for data collection.

The main methods of research are:

1. Survey Method
2. Observation Method
3. Case Method
4. Experimental Method
5. Historical Method
6. Comparative Method

Each of these methods is explained briefly in the following sections.

### 1.8.1 Survey Method

The word **survey** means to observe, examine, study, or systematically investigate something. The survey method is used to study both **large and small populations**. It is mainly a **fact-finding method** and is commonly used to study real-life or empirical problems. A survey involves careful examination to collect information about a particular condition or how widespread it is.

Examples of surveys include **marketing surveys, household surveys, and the All India Rural Credit Survey**.

Survey research is one of the most popular methods in social science research. With the development of better sampling techniques, survey research has grown as a separate research activity. Today, **sample surveys** are widely used, and in many cases, the term survey itself refers to a sample survey.

Some definitions of survey research are given below:

According to Black and Champion, survey research is the **procedure of collecting information about a large group of people by studying only a small selected group**.

Fred N. Kerlinger defined survey research as the **study of samples taken from a population to understand the distribution, occurrence, and relationships of social and psychological variables**.

In survey research, data can be collected using different methods such as **observation, personal interviews, mailed questionnaires, schedules, and telephone enquiries**.

### Features of Survey Method

The important features of the survey method are as follows:

**i)** It is a **field study** because it is conducted in a natural or real-life setting.

**ii)** It collects responses **directly from respondents** or from people who have proper knowledge about the problem being studied.

**iii)** It usually gathers information from a **large population**.

**iv)** A survey covers a **specific geographical area**, such as a village, city, or district.

**v)** Every survey is carried out within a **fixed time period**.

**vi)** A survey may be:

  * **Extensive**, covering a large sample, or
  * **Intensive**, covering a small sample but involving detailed and in-depth study.

**vii)** Survey research is best suited for collecting information on **personal details, socio-economic conditions, beliefs, attitudes, and opinions**.

Survey research is not a simple clerical task of collecting facts and figures. It requires proper research knowledge and skill. A good survey researcher must understand **sampling methods, questionnaire or schedule design, interviewing techniques**, and other technical aspects. The quality of survey results depends on **careful planning, proper sampling, reliable data, and correct analysis and interpretation** of the data.
