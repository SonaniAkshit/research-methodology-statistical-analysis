## 1.1 Introduction

Research is an important part of building knowledge in a planned and organised way. Since ancient times, humans have always tried to understand the world around them. The desire to learn new things and to find solutions to problems has led people to search, study, and re-study different ideas. Because of this, research has become a regular part of almost every area of human activity.

In simple words, research means a search for knowledge. It is an effort to find answers to problems, whether they are theoretical or practical, by using scientific methods. Research is a systematic process where facts are collected using objective and verifiable methods. These facts are then analysed to understand their relationships and to draw general conclusions. In this way, research helps in developing logical and critical thinking.

In today’s globalised business environment, every organisation needs accurate and timely information. This information, along with proper analytical tools, helps managers take better decisions with less risk.
For example, before launching a new product, a company may conduct research to understand customer needs and market demand.

In this unit, we will discuss the need and importance of research, different types and methods of research, and the steps involved in the research process.

## 1.2 Meaning of Research

The *Random House Dictionary of the English Language* defines **research** as a careful and systematic study of a subject to discover new facts or to improve existing knowledge, theories, or applications. This definition clearly shows that research is a way of gaining knowledge.

Research means a **search for truth**. Truth refers to facts that match reality and can be tested or verified. When a person does research, the aim is to get closer to the truth and to understand real situations more clearly.

Research is the effort to find truth by using methods such as **study, observation, comparison, and experimentation**. In simple terms, research is a systematic and objective way of finding answers to questions or solutions to problems.

However, research does not always guarantee a final answer or solution. Even if the expected result is not achieved, the process itself adds to knowledge. As Karl Pearson rightly said:

> “There is no shortcut to truth… no way to gain knowledge of the universe except through the gateway of scientific method.”

This statement highlights that only scientific and systematic methods can help us understand reality accurately.

Let us now look at some definitions of research.

### Definitions of Research

L.V. Redman and A.V.H. Mory, in their book *The Romance of Research*, defined research as **a systematic effort to gain new knowledge**. This means research is not done randomly but follows an organised and planned approach.

According to C.R. Kothari, in *Research Methodology: Methods and Techniques*, **research is a scientific and systematic search for relevant information on a specific topic**. This definition highlights the importance of using scientific methods and focusing on useful information.

The *Advanced Learner’s Dictionary of Current English* defines research as **a careful investigation or inquiry, especially through the search for new facts in any field of knowledge**. This shows that research aims at discovering something new.

Research can also be explained as a process that includes **identifying a problem, forming a hypothesis, collecting data, analysing the data, and drawing conclusions**. These conclusions may provide a solution to the problem or help in forming general theories.

D. Slesinger and M. Stephenson, in the *Encyclopedia of Social Sciences*, defined research as **the use of things, ideas, or symbols to generalise, extend, correct, or verify knowledge**, whether that knowledge is useful for building theories or for practical applications.

To understand the meaning of research clearly and completely, let us analyse the above definitions in detail.
