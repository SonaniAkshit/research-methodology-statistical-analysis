## UNIT 1: Introduction to Business Research – Complete Summary

Research is a **systematic and planned way of finding answers** to questions and solving problems. Humans have always tried to understand their surroundings, and this need has led to research. In simple terms, research means a **search for truth or facts** using scientific and logical methods. It helps us understand reality and make better decisions.

### Meaning of Research

Research is a **careful and organised investigation** to discover new facts or verify existing ones. It does not always guarantee an answer, but it always adds to knowledge. Research uses methods like observation, comparison, and experimentation. There is no shortcut to truth; only scientific methods help us reach it.

### Science and Knowledge

Science comes from the word *Scientia*, which means knowledge. Science can be understood in two ways:

* As an **organised body of knowledge**
* As a **method or process of gaining knowledge**

All science is knowledge, but **not all knowledge is science**. Scientific knowledge is systematic, organised, and verified, while ordinary knowledge may be scattered and based on personal experience.

Knowledge is based on **beliefs supported by evidence**. Only beliefs that are tested and verified become knowledge. Science helps in explaining and organising knowledge.

### Inductive and Deductive Logic

Research uses two types of logical reasoning:

* **Induction**: Moving from specific facts to a general conclusion.
  Example: If prices rise in many cases and demand falls, we conclude that higher prices reduce demand.
* **Deduction**: Moving from a general rule to a specific case.
  Example: All managers need decision-making skills. Ram is a manager. So, Ram needs decision-making skills.

Both help in building knowledge.

### Significance of Research in Business

Research is very important for business because:

* Business decisions involve large money and many people.
* Trial and error is risky and costly.
* Research helps in **quick, accurate, and fact-based decisions**.
* It supports planning, forecasting, controlling, and strategy making.
* Research helps in all functional areas like **production, marketing, finance, HR, accounting**, etc.
* R&D helps in **new products, new markets, and innovation**.
* Businesses need continuous research to survive in a changing environment.

### Types of Research

Research can be classified in many ways:

* **By branch of knowledge**: Life sciences and social sciences (business research comes under social sciences).
* **By nature of data**:

  * Quantitative: Number-based (sales, profit, costs)
  * Qualitative: Attribute-based (opinions, attitudes)
* **By coverage**:

  * Macro study: Whole system
  * Micro study: Part of the system
* **By application**:

  * Basic research: Expands knowledge
  * Applied research: Solves practical problems
* **By place**: Field, laboratory, or library research
* **By time frame**:

  * One-time study
  * Longitudinal study
* **By purpose**:

  * Descriptive
  * Analytical
  * Evaluation
  * Exploratory

### Methods of Research

To answer research questions, data must be collected using proper methods. The main methods are:

* **Survey Method**: Fact-finding from respondents in a natural setting.
* **Observation Method**: Systematic watching of behaviour or events.
* **Case Method**: In-depth study of a single unit like a firm or group.
* **Experimental Method**: Studying cause and effect under controlled conditions.
* **Historical Method**: Using past data and records to understand trends.
* **Comparative Method**: Studying similarities, differences, and evolution.

### Difficulties in Business Research (India)

Business researchers face many problems such as:

* Lack of research training
* Shortage of skilled researchers and guides
* Low support from businesses
* High cost of R&D for small firms
* Poor industry–academic interaction
* Confidentiality of business data
* Lack of funds and facilities
* Delayed availability of data
* No clear code of research ethics

Despite these problems, research is unavoidable for business survival.

### Business Research Process

The research process includes:

1. Selecting a research problem
2. Reviewing existing literature
3. Defining the problem clearly
4. Setting objectives or hypotheses
5. Identifying data sources
6. Designing data collection tools
7. Pre-testing tools
8. Collecting data
9. Analysing data
10. Interpreting results and writing the report

### Final Conclusion

Business research is a **powerful tool for decision making**. It helps businesses understand problems, reduce risk, improve performance, and adapt to change. Without research, modern business cannot survive or grow.
